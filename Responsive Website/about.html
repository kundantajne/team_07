                <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production he web applicationand maintenance of
                    website design done to . The
                    different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including
                    standardised code and
                    proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many
                    individuals will work in teams
                    covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1]
                    The term web design
                    is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a
                    website including
                    writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
                    development. Web designers
                    are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they
                    are also expected
                    to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
                <p>Everything about your website - including the content, the way it looks, and the way it works - is
                    determined by the
                    website design. Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of
                    electronic files
                    that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive
                    features that
                    deliver pages to your site visitors. Professional Web design helps to make your business appear
                    credible online.</p>
